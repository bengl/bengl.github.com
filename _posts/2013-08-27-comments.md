I don't want to restrict people to Facebook for comments, so as of this post, comments are now hosted by [Disqus](http://disqus.com/). I'm open to suggestions though. If there's a better commenting system I can add without any backend work and allows authentication through multiple providers (including email), then I might be open to switch. I don't often get comments, so this isn't really a big deal, but I'd still like to not be too restrictive about comment authentication and still avoid spam.

Let me know what you think.
