<h1>Flightsy</h1>

<p><b>Flightsy</b> is an Android app for creating tweetable itineraries. That is, itineraries of the form "SFO &#x2708; JFK &#x2708; LHR", etc. </p>
<p>At the moment, it's not quite ready for general use, so I've made it available here rather than the Android Market for now. Therefore, you'll need to <a href="http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/22616/android-allow-installation-of-non-market-apps/">enable non-Market apps</a>.</p>
<p>For simplicity's sake, this will currently only run on Android 4.0+.</p>
