I don't use this key anymore due to the Infineon issue:
https://www.yubico.com/2017/10/infineon-rsa-key-generation-issue

Older GPG Fingerprint (4096R):
F2FE 3552 09D6 F280 BF6A  B807 FE32 AE04 E6BF 5E9E
Switched to 7970799A, since it was kept on a Yubikey.

Former (Revoked) GPG Fingerprint (4096R):
12DA A122 E4B0 3089 0F5D  A100 02E1 DF2D F935 CE6D
Switched to E6BF5E9E, since it was being kept more secure.

Note also that you may find the GPG key ID F68B2B1E associated
with me on various keyservers. While I did originally create
this key, I have lost the private key, so I not longer use it.
I have no reason to believe it was compromised.
