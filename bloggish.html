<h1>Bloggish</h1>

<p>This is a "bloggish" in that it's not quite the same as a blog. The primary difference between this thing and a blog is that blogs are typically updated on a regular basis, and as you can tell by the dates, this is not.</p>
<p>Also, like most people, my opinions, ideas, knowledge and standpoints change over time. I may not agree today with what I wrote a year or two ago (or more!). I mean, I don't even really like my writing style at all in some of these posts. Therefore, take everything with a grain or two of salt.</p>

<p>Anyways here are the bloggish posts:</p>
<ul>
{% for post in site.posts %}
  <li>{{ post.date | date_to_string }} <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<p>Some newer posts can be found on <a href="https://dev.to/bengl">dev.to</a>.
