<h1>Flightsy</h1>

<p><b>Flightsy</b> is an Android app for creating tweetable itineraries. That is, itineraries of the form "SFO &#x2708; JFK &#x2708; LHR", etc. </p>
<p>At the moment, it's not quite ready for general use, so I've made it available here rather than the Android Market for now. For simplicity's sake, this will currently only run on Android 4.0+.</p>
